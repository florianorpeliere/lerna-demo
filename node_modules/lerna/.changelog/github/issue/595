  "body": "Expanding on the work done in https://github.com/lerna/lerna/pull/412 by @seansfkelley.\r\n\r\nThis makes the `publish` command publish packages to npm in topological order so that there is never a time where npm could have a package whose dependencies do not yet exist in the registry. There's already some `dist-tags` toggling going on, but that doesn't have any effect on users who already have dependencies on a version range in their deps.\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome. Main questions:\r\n\r\nIf you have dependency cycles in your repo, this means Lerna will start logging `\"Encountered a cycle in the dependency graph. This may cause instability!\"` on every call to `lerna publish` where it wouldn't have before, is that cool?",
